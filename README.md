# playlist-m3u-generator
This script converts "file:///" links in UTF-8 m3u8 files generated by Eric Daugherty's iTunes Export utility into web urls. The resulting m3u file can be opened in a variety of different music player apps (Goodplayer for iOS, or VLC on computers) to play a streamed music playlist.
